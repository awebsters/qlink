## Development 

Details front-end and back-end designs and technologies used for implementation.

### Front-end Design
The team used Adobe XD to create multiple prototypes of the front-end UI/UX. This program allowed us to include basic user inputs/interactions to perfect the design that was created through extensive research into current related competitive offering and popular design standards like Google's Material Design.
